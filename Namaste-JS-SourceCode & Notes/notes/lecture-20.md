# Chapter 20 : Callback


# 🚀 What Are Callbacks?
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function.

There are two parts to callbacks:

# Good Part of Callbacks:

**1. Asynchronous Operations:**

Callbacks are crucial for handling asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, allowing code to run without blocking the main thread.

Example: Delaying execution using setTimeout() or repeating tasks using setInterval().
Why Use Callbacks: They ensure that the next operation only runs after the previous one completes.

```js

  console.log("Start");
  setTimeout(function() {
      console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  console.log("End");

  // Output:
  // Start
  // End
  // Executed after 2 seconds

```

**2. Event Handling:**

Callbacks are heavily used in event-driven programming to respond to user interactions like clicks, key presses, or form submissions.

Example: Handling button clicks with addEventListener().
Why Use Callbacks: They ensure that specific code runs when an event is triggered.


```js
    
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Button Clicked!");
    });

```

**3. Higher-Order Functions:**

Callbacks are often used with higher-order functions to make code more modular and readable.

Example: Using functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() that accept callbacks to perform operations on each element of an array.
Why Use Callbacks: They make complex operations more concise and easier to understand.

```js

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squared = numbers.map(function(num) {
    return num * num;
});

console.log(squared); // [1, 4, 9, 16]

```

**4. Custom Logic Execution:**

Callbacks allow us to define custom logic that executes after completing a specific operation.

Example: Executing a function after processing some data or completing a calculation.
Why Use Callbacks: They give flexibility to decide what to do next based on the result.

```js
  function processData(data, callback) {
      console.log("Processing data: " + data);
      callback();
  }

  processData("Sample Data", function() {
      console.log("Data processed successfully!");
  });
```

**5. Functional Programming:**

In functional programming, callbacks help write reusable and modular code.

Example: Passing a function as an argument to another function for performing specific tasks.
Why Use Callbacks: They enable creating generic functions that can work with various operations.

```js

const radiusArr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Logic to calculate area
const area = function(radius) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
};

// Logic to calculate circumference
const circumference = function(radius) {
    return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
};

// Higher-Order Function (HOF) - Takes an array and operation as arguments
const calculate = function(radiusArr, operation) {
    const output = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < radiusArr.length; i++) {
        output.push(operation(radiusArr[i])); // Applying operation to each element
    }
    return output;
};

console.log(calculate(radiusArr, area));          // Calculates area
console.log(calculate(radiusArr, circumference)); // Calculates circumference

```


# Bad Part of Callbacks:

When callbacks are nested inside other callbacks, it leads to issues like:
Callback Hell(discussed later): Code becomes deeply nested and hard to read.
Inversion of Control(discussed later): Flow of control is given to the callback function, making error handling and debugging difficult.


# Synchronous Nature of JavaScript

JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language. It can do just one thing at a time because it has only one call stack to execute code line by line. It does not wait for operations to complete.


console.log("Namaste");
console.log("JavaScript");
console.log("Season 2");

// Output:
// Namaste
// JavaScript
// Season 2


**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

-> console.log("Namaste") is executed first, printing Namaste.

-> Next, console.log("JavaScript") is executed, printing JavaScript.

-> Finally, console.log("Season 2") is executed, printing Season 2.

All statements are executed synchronously, one after another.

# ⏳ Delaying Code Execution Using Callbacks

What if we want to delay the execution of any line? We can utilize callbacks to achieve this.


console.log("Namaste");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("JavaScript");
}, 5000);

console.log("Season 2");

// Output:
// Namaste
// Season 2
// JavaScript (after 5 seconds)

// 💡 Here we are delaying the execution using the callback approach of setTimeout.

# ✅ Why Are Callbacks Important?

Callbacks are crucial for asynchronous programming. Without them, JavaScript would block the main thread, waiting for tasks like API responses or file reading to complete. Instead, callbacks allow us to run other code while waiting for these tasks.


# Understanding Callback Hell


**🔥 What is Callback Hell?**

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, occurs when multiple asynchronous operations rely on each other and are deeply nested within callbacks.
This leads to code that is difficult to read and maintain especially in large codebases.

**🛒 Real-Life Scenario: e-Commerce Web App**

Imagine an e-commerce website where a user places an order. The user has added items like shoes, pants, and a kurta to the cart. To complete the order, the backend needs to perform the following steps sequentially:

  -> step 1 - Create an order
  -> step 2 - Proceed to payment
  -> step 3 - Show the order summary
  -> step 4 - Update the wallet balance

Since these steps have dependencies on each other, we must ensure that each operation only starts after the previous one finishes. This is where callbacks come into play.

**🚀 Simulating the api Object**

The api object here is a simulated set of asynchronous functions to mimic network delays and real-world API responses. Each function uses setTimeout to create a delay, simulating a backend operation.


```js 

  const api = {
    
    createOrder: function (cart, callback) {  // Simulates creating an order
      console.log("Creating order with items:", cart);
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("✅ Order created successfully.");
        callback();  // Calls the next step
      }, 1000); 
    },

    
    proceedToPayment: function (callback) {  // Simulates proceeding to payment
      console.log("Proceeding to payment...");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("💰 Payment processed successfully.");
        callback();  // Calls the next step
      }, 1000);
    },

    
    showOrderSummary: function (callback) { // Simulates showing the order summary
      console.log("Fetching order summary...");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("📦 Order summary displayed.");
        callback(); // Calls the next step
      }, 1000);
    },

    
    updateWallet: function () { // Simulates updating the wallet
      console.log("Updating wallet balance...");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("💵 Wallet balance updated.");
      }, 1000);
    },
  };

const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

api.createOrder(cart, function () {     // Callback hell situation (Pyramid of Doom)
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.updateWallet(); // Just logs the message, no next callback
      console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
    });
  });
});


```

Let's break down the entire callback chain, step by step:

**Step 1: Creating an Order**

api.createOrder(cart, function () {...})

-> The createOrder function is called with two arguments:
   cart: An array of items to order.
   callback: A function that will be executed after the order is created.

-> Inside createOrder: A message is logged:
   Creating order with items: ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"]


-> A setTimeout function simulates a delay of 1 second (1000 ms).
After the delay, it logs: ✅ Order created successfully.

-> Finally, the callback() function is called to proceed to the next step.


Why use a Callback here?
The callback ensures that the next step (proceeding to payment) only happens after the order creation is completed.

**Step 2: Proceeding to Payment**

api.proceedToPayment(function () {...})

-> After the order is created, the proceedToPayment function is called.

-> This function logs:Proceeding to payment...

-> Again, a setTimeout simulates a delay of 1 second.
After the delay, it logs: 💰 Payment processed successfully.

-> Finally, it calls the next callback function to show the order summary.

Why Chain Another Callback?

Since payment can only happen after an order is created, the callback ensures the flow is maintained without breaking the sequence.

**Step 3: Showing the Order Summary**


api.showOrderSummary(function () {...})

-> Once the payment is done, the showOrderSummary function is invoked.

-> It logs the message:Fetching order summary...

-> Another delay is simulated using setTimeout.
   After the delay, it logs:📦 Order summary displayed.

-> The callback function is then called to update the wallet.

Why Another Callback?
Order summary should only be shown after successful payment, maintaining the logical flow of operations.

**Step 4: Updating the Wallet**

api.updateWallet();

-> The final step is updating the wallet balance.
-> The updateWallet function logs:
Updating wallet balance...

-> After a delay, it logs:
💵 Wallet balance updated.

-> Finally, outside the callback chain, it logs:
🎉 Order process completed!

Unlike the previous functions, there is no callback for updateWallet since it’s the final step.


# 🔥 Why Is Callback Hell a Problem?

When working with a large codebase that has a number of APIs with internal dependencies, we may encounter Callback Hell. This happens when asynchronous operations are nested within each other, making the code grow horizontally in a pyramid-like structure. As a result, the code becomes difficult to read and maintain. This problematic structure is commonly known as the Pyramid of Doom.


**😵 1. Difficult to Add or Modify Steps**

Adding or changing steps in a callback hell structure is a nightmare.

Example Scenario: Imagine you want to add a "Send Confirmation Email" step between showOrderSummary and updateWallet.

You have to:

-> Dig Deep: Find the correct place in the nested callbacks to add the new step.
-> Add Another Callback: Introduce a new callback inside the deepest level.

```js

const api = {
  createOrder: function (cart, successCallback) {
    console.log("Creating order with items:", cart);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("✅ Order created successfully.");
      successCallback();
    }, 1000);
  },

  proceedToPayment: function (successCallback) {
    console.log("Proceeding to payment...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("💰 Payment processed successfully.");
      successCallback();
    }, 1000);
  },

  showOrderSummary: function (successCallback) {
    console.log("Fetching order summary...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("📦 Order summary displayed.");
      successCallback();
    }, 1000);
  },

  sendConfirmationEmail: function (successCallback) {
    console.log("Sending confirmation email...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("✉️ Confirmation email sent.");
      successCallback();
    }, 1000);
  },

  updateWallet: function (successCallback) {
    console.log("Updating wallet balance...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("💵 Wallet balance updated.");
      successCallback();
    }, 1000);
  },
};

const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.sendConfirmationEmail(function () { // New step added here
        api.updateWallet(function () {
          console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
        });
      });
    });
  });
});


```
💡 Why It’s a Problem:

-> Messy Code: The more steps you add, the more cluttered and confusing it becomes.
-> Complex Modifications: Changing the order of steps or adding/removing steps is risky and error-prone.



**⚠️ 2. Hard to Track Errors**

Handling errors in a callback hell structure is chaotic.

Example Scenario:

If the proceedToPayment function fails (like a payment gateway issue), it’s not clear where the error occurred.

```js

const api = {
  createOrder: function (cart, successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Creating order with items:", cart);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2; // Simulate success or failure
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✅ Order created successfully.");
        successCallback();  
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to create order.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  proceedToPayment: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Proceeding to payment...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2; // Simulate success or failure
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💰 Payment processed successfully.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Payment processing failed.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  showOrderSummary: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Fetching order summary...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2; // Simulate success or failure
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("📦 Order summary displayed.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to display order summary.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  sendConfirmationEmail: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Sending confirmation email...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2; // Simulate success or failure
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✉️ Confirmation email sent.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to send confirmation email.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  updateWallet: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Updating wallet balance...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2; // Simulate success or failure
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💵 Wallet balance updated.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to update wallet balance.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },
};


const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.sendConfirmationEmail(function () {  
        api.updateWallet(function () {
          console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
        }, function (error) {
          console.error("❌ Wallet update error:", error);
        });
      }, function (error) {
        console.error("❌ Email sending error:", error);
      });
    }, function (error) {
      console.error("❌ Order summary error:", error);
    });
  }, function (error) {
    console.error("❌ Payment error:", error);
  });
}, function (error) {
  console.error("❌ Order creation error:", error);
});


```


💡 Why It’s a Problem:

-> Repetitive Logic: You end up writing similar error-handling code in every callback.
In the nested callback structure, each step of the process requires its own error-handling logic.
For example, in this code, each API call has an errorCallback that logs an error message:

Notice that every single step repeats the same pattern of:

  1.Performing an action.
  2.Checking if it succeeds.
  3.Handling an error if it doesn't.

This makes the code unnecessarily long and harder to maintain because:

  1.You are duplicating the same error-handling logic over and over.
  2.Any change to the error-handling mechanism would require updating multiple places.



-> Chaotic Flow: 


If one step fails, it becomes challenging to properly stop or reverse the previous steps.

For example:

If proceedToPayment fails, should you reverse the order creation?
If sendConfirmationEmail fails, should you roll back the payment?
Handling such scenarios in a callback hell structure is messy because
  1.You would need to write additional callbacks to reverse each step.
  2.The code flow becomes chaotic and difficult to manage.

If a step like proceedToPayment or sendConfirmationEmail fails, the code returns an error message. However, returning an error message is not the same as rolling back or reversing the previous steps.


🔄 Rollback vs. Error Message -

Error Message: Simply logs the error and stops further execution. It doesn't undo the previous successful operations.

Rollback: Actively reverses or compensates for the changes made in the previous steps (like canceling the order if payment fails).

Example Scenario:

1.You successfully create an order (step 1).
2.The payment fails (step 2).
3.The error message "❌ Payment error: Payment processing failed" is logged.
Now you have an orphaned order in your system that was created but never paid for.
4.The problem is that:
    The order still exists even though the payment failed.
    You may need to delete or cancel the order to maintain consistency.
    In a real-world scenario, this would cause data inconsistencies and potential user confusion.


🚩 Why Callback Hell Makes It Worse:
Handling such rollbacks becomes complicated because:
You would have to write separate rollback functions for each step.
You would also have to nest these rollback functions within each callback, making the structure even more chaotic and harder to maintain.


-> Debugging Nightmare: You must track errors manually at each step, which is error-prone.

Let's say you see this error in the console:

❌ Payment error: Payment processing failed.

Problem 1: No Clarity on the Root Cause
You know that the payment step failed, but you don't know why. There could be multiple reasons:

Network Issue: The payment gateway itself might be down.
Invalid Order ID: The order ID generated in the createOrder step might be invalid or missing.
Internal Server Issue: The payment processing server could be experiencing issues.

🚩 Why Tracing Back Is Hard:
The error message in proceedToPayment only tells you that payment failed.

It doesn’t tell you:
Whether the previous step (createOrder) was successful in generating a valid order ID.
Whether there was a data issue passed from createOrder to proceedToPayment.

To find the root cause, you’d have to:
Go through the callback hierarchy manually.
Check the output of each preceding step.
Trace the data passed from one callback to another.

🔄 What If Preceding Steps Are the Problem?
Suppose the createOrder step successfully calls the success callback, but it actually generated a corrupted order ID.

The proceedToPayment step would still run, using this corrupted ID.
Since the payment step only handles its own errors, it doesn’t know that the problem was caused by the previous step.
❌ Payment error: Payment processing failed.

However, the real problem was in createOrder, not proceedToPayment.

📝 Why Callback Hell Makes It Worse:
Isolated Error Handlers: Each step has its own error handler, making it hard to centralize error reporting.
Loss of Context: Once you move to the next callback, you lose context about the previous step.
Nested Structure: You would need to dive deep into nested functions to trace the issue.




**3.Hard to Read**


Why is Callback Hell Hard to Read?

Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom," occurs when there are multiple nested callback functions. As asynchronous operations increase, the nesting becomes deeper and harder to manage. Let's break down why this structure is challenging to read and maintain.

1. Indentation Nightmare

-> The nested structure resembles a pyramid shape, where each new callback adds another level of indentation.
-> This makes the code visually cluttered and confusing.
->The deeper the nesting, the harder it becomes to follow the flow.

2. Difficult to Follow the Flow

-> You can't quickly understand the sequence of steps just by looking at the code.
-> The logic becomes scattered across multiple nested functions.
-> It’s time-consuming to trace each callback and understand the overall flow.

3. Repeated and Messy Error Handling

-> Each step often has its own error callback function.
-> This leads to repetitive error handling logic, making the code bloated.
-> Handling errors at multiple levels becomes confusing and error-prone.

4. Tight Coupling of Functions

-> The functions are tightly bound together, making it difficult to reuse individual steps.
-> Changing one function may impact the entire chain, breaking the code or introducing bugs.




**🪲 4. Difficult to Debug**

When something breaks, finding the root cause in deeply nested callbacks is a headache.

Example Scenario: 

If you see an error message like "Payment failed", it’s hard to determine:
What triggered that failure.
Whether it was caused by the preceding steps or the current one.

🪲 Why It’s Hard to Debug in This Context:

1. Confusing Flow:
-> In callback hell, functions are nested within functions, making it hard to follow the flow.
-> The code doesn’t follow a top-to-bottom linear path, so you have to jump between callbacks to understand the sequence.
-> Even if you find where the failure is logged, it doesn’t guarantee that you’ve found why it failed.

2. Time-Consuming:
-> You might spend hours tracing back through each callback to see if the failure originated in a previous step.
-> For example, if proceedToPayment fails, you might have to:
      Check the createOrder step to ensure the order ID was generated correctly.
      Validate the data passed between callbacks to see if something got corrupted or was missing.
-> If the error message only says "Payment processing failed", it doesn't tell you whether the problem was:
      A network issue during payment.
      An invalid order ID from the previous step.
      A data mismatch between callbacks.
      

Let’s understand the problem of debugging using the same example, but with clearer and better English.

```js

api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.sendConfirmationEmail(function () {
        api.updateWallet(function () {
          console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
        }, function (error) {
          console.error("❌ Wallet update error:", error);
        });
      }, function (error) {
        console.error("❌ Email sending error:", error);
      });
    }, function (error) {
      console.error("❌ Order summary error:", error);
    });
  }, function (error) {
    console.error("❌ Payment error:", error);
  });
}, function (error) {
  console.error("❌ Order creation error:", error);
});

```

🔄 Problem in Debugging:

Nested Error Handling:
-> Each step has its own error callback.
-> If the payment step fails, the error handler only shows the payment error message, but it doesn’t indicate whether:
    - The order creation step produced an invalid ID.
    - There was inconsistent data passed between steps.

Disjointed Error Logs:
-> The error message is isolated to the current step.
-> You would have to go back manually and inspect previous logs to verify each step.

No Contextual Information:
-> The payment error message doesn’t provide insights about the preceding steps.
-> You would have to add debug statements at every level just to track the progress and data at each stage.



🚩 Why It’s a Problem:

-> The deep nesting makes it hard to see the entire flow at once.
-> You can’t tell whether the problem started earlier or if it genuinely failed at the current step.
-> Isolated error handlers make it difficult to correlate errors across multiple steps.



# 🔄 How Do We Propagate Errors in Callback Hell?

In the callback hell example, we are manually handling errors at each level. 
If an error occurs at any level, it is handled at that specific level itself using the error callback defined at that level. The error does not "pass back" to the previous level.

💻 Example: Error Propagation in Callbacks

```js

const api = {
  createOrder: function (cart, successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Creating order with items:", cart);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✅ Order created successfully.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to create order.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  proceedToPayment: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Proceeding to payment...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💰 Payment processed successfully.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Payment processing failed.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  showOrderSummary: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Fetching order summary...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("📦 Order summary displayed.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to display order summary.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  sendConfirmationEmail: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Sending confirmation email...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✉️ Confirmation email sent.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to send confirmation email.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },

  updateWallet: function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
    console.log("Updating wallet balance...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💵 Wallet balance updated.");
        successCallback();
      } else {
        errorCallback("Failed to update wallet balance.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  },
};


const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.sendConfirmationEmail(function () {
        api.updateWallet(function () {
          console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
        }, function (error) {
          console.error("❌ Wallet update error:", error);
        });
      }, function (error) {
        console.error("❌ Email sending error:", error);
      });
    }, function (error) {
      console.error("❌ Order summary error:", error);
    });
  }, function (error) {
    console.error("❌ Payment error:", error);
  });
}, function (error) {
  console.error("❌ Order creation error:", error);
});



```

**🔁Error Propagation through the Chain -**

✅ Success Flow:
Order Creation Success: Moves to payment.
Payment Success: Moves to order summary.
Order Summary Success: Moves to email sending.
Email Sending Success: Moves to wallet update.
Wallet Update Success: Logs "🎉 Order process completed!".

❌ Error Flow:
Error at Any Step:
The error callback for that step gets called.
The error message is passed as an argument to that callback.
The error is immediately logged and stops further execution.


**🔗 Understanding Error Propagation**

Error propagation in callback chains is essential for handling failures effectively. In a callback chain, multiple functions are executed one after another, with each function having its own success and error callbacks.

When an error occurs at any level, it is immediately handled by the error callback defined at that level. The error does not automatically propagate back up to the calling function or the top-level API. To understand this better, let's break it down with a real-world analogy.



**🍕 Analogy: The Pizza Delivery Chain**

Imagine a pizza delivery chain where each worker has a specific task in the pizza-making process:

Worker 1 (Order Taker): Takes the order and passes it to the next worker.

Worker 2 (Pizza Maker): Prepares the pizza and passes it to the next worker if successful.

Worker 3 (Quality Checker): Checks the pizza quality and passes it on.

Worker 4 (Packer): Packs the pizza and passes it to the delivery person.

Worker 5 (Delivery Person): Delivers the pizza to the customer.

❌ What if Something Goes Wrong?

If Worker 3 (Quality Checker) finds that the pizza is burnt, they immediately notify Worker 2 (Pizza Maker) to redo it. The error does not go back to Worker 1 (Order Taker) directly. Instead, Worker 2 is responsible for fixing it. The error stops there because it’s already caught and handled.


**🚀 Code Example: Error Callback Chain**

Here’s a simplified chain of how API calls are made:

```js 
api.createOrder(cart, function () {  // Level 1
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {  // Level 2
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {  // Level 3
      api.sendConfirmationEmail(function () {  // Level 4
        api.updateWallet(function () {  // Level 5
          console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
        }, function (error) {  // Error Handler for Wallet Update (Level 5)
          console.error("❌ Wallet update error:", error);
        });
      }, function (error) {  // Error Handler for Email Sending (Level 4)
        console.error("❌ Email sending error:", error);
      });
    }, function (error) {  // Error Handler for Order Summary (Level 3)
      console.error("❌ Order summary error:", error);
    });
  }, function (error) {  // Error Handler for Payment (Level 2)
    console.error("❌ Payment error:", error);
  });
}, function (error) {  // Error Handler for Order Creation (Level 1)
  console.error("❌ Order creation error:", error);
});

```

**🕵️‍♂️ Breaking Down Error Propagation**


Deepest Level Error (Wallet Update Fails):

api.updateWallet() fails and calls its error callback.

The error callback function logs the error message:

function (error) {
  console.error("❌ Wallet update error:", error);
}

The error does not go back further because it’s already handled at this level.



Mid-Level Error (Payment Fails):

api.proceedToPayment() fails and triggers its error callback.

The callback logs:

function (error) {
  console.error("❌ Payment error:", error);
}

The error stops here and does not propagate back to the top level.



✅ Key Takeaways - 

-> Each API function has its own success and error callback.

-> If an error occurs at a deeper level, it is handled immediately and does not propagate back up.

-> The top-level function only knows about errors that occur at its own level.

-> There is no automatic error bubbling in callbacks. Errors must be caught and handled at each specific level.


**🚩 What’s the Problem with This Approach?**

Manual Propagation:
Each function in the callback chain has its own error callback that we must explicitly call whenever an error occurs.
If we forget to call the error callback in any nested function, the error does not propagate further and gets silently swallowed. This results in the error not being logged or handled, making it difficult to trace the issue.



Missed Callbacks:

If we make a mistake and forget to handle an error in any of the functions, the entire sequence can halt silently without any feedback.
This means that the error will never be caught or logged, making it hard to trace the failure.

For example:
If we forget to handle the error in proceedToPayment:

api.proceedToPayment(function () {
  api.showOrderSummary(function () {
    // Next steps...
  }); // 🔴 No error handling here!
});
In this case, if the payment processing fails, the error message will never be shown, and the order process will just stop without giving any feedback to the user.


Silent Failures:

If an error callback is not called properly or is misconfigured, the failure may go unnoticed.
This can happen if we accidentally pass the wrong callback function, causing the error to be treated as a success.
This leads to false positives and incomplete error handling, making it hard to detect issues.
For example:
If we mistakenly pass the success callback instead of the error callback in proceedToPayment:

api.proceedToPayment(function () {
  console.log("✅ Payment successful");
}, successCallback); // 🔴 Passing the wrong callback here
In this scenario, if the payment processing fails, the error will be misinterpreted as a successful operation, leading to confusing results.



**💡 Real Issue: Uncaught or Swallowed Errors**

When an error is not correctly handled at one level, it does not propagate up the chain to higher-level functions.
This results in silent failures, where the system appears to be working fine while errors are being ignored.
The lack of centralized error handling makes it extremely challenging to trace the problem and respond correctly.


# Avoiding Callback Hell

To overcome these challenges, we can use Promises or async/await to make the code cleaner, more readable, and easier to manage. We will explore these concepts in depth in the next chapter.
For now, if you come across such terms, there’s no need to worry or dive into them immediately. We’ll cover them thoroughly when the time comes.



**💡 How Promises and Async/Await Help**

Promises and async/await are designed to make asynchronous code more readable and manageable by eliminating callback hell.

**🚀 Promises**

-> Promises flatten the chain, making the code more linear and readable.
-> Errors are caught in one place, reducing repetitive error handling.
-> Chaining is clean and easy to follow.
-> With .catch() at the end of the chain, any error occurring in any of the previous steps is caught and handled centrally, avoiding error swallowing.


🌟 Promise-Based API Code Implementation -

```js

function createOrder(cart) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Creating order with items:", cart);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✅ Order created successfully.");
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject("Failed to create order.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function proceedToPayment() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Proceeding to payment...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💰 Payment processed successfully.");
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject("Payment processing failed.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function showOrderSummary() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Fetching order summary...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("📦 Order summary displayed.");
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject("Failed to display order summary.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function sendConfirmationEmail() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Sending confirmation email...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("✉️ Confirmation email sent.");
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject("Failed to send confirmation email.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function updateWallet() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Updating wallet balance...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const isSuccess = Math.random() > 0.2;
      if (isSuccess) {
        console.log("💵 Wallet balance updated.");
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject("Failed to update wallet balance.");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}


createOrder(["shoes", "pants", "kurta"])
  .then(() => proceedToPayment())
  .then(() => showOrderSummary())
  .then(() => sendConfirmationEmail())
  .then(() => updateWallet())
  .then(() => console.log("🎉 Order process completed!"))
  .catch((error) => console.error("❌ Error:", error));


 ``` 

**🌀 Async/Await**

-> Makes async code look and feel like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.
-> Uses try-catch to handle errors in one place, keeping the code clean and manageable.
-> Gets rid of deeply nested callbacks, reducing complexity and making the code flow naturally.
-> Makes error handling straightforward without needing to attach multiple .catch() methods.


🌟 Async/Await Code Example -

```js

async function processOrder(cart) {
  try {
    await createOrder(cart);
    await proceedToPayment();
    await showOrderSummary();
    await sendConfirmationEmail();
    await updateWallet();
    console.log("🎉 Order process completed!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error);
  }
}

processOrder(["shoes", "pants", "kurta"]);

```

By using Promises and Async/Await, we address the major issues with callback hell and make asynchronous code more readable, maintainable, and error-resistant.
Don’t worry if you find it challenging to understand code written with Promises and async/await right now. We will take a deep dive into each of these concepts in the next chapter.


Up to this point, we’ve gained a good understanding of the concept of callback hell. Now, let’s move on to discussing Inversion of Control. It’s crucial to grasp this concept to feel more comfortable with Promises.


# 💡 Inversion of Control 

**What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?**

-> Inversion of Control (IoC) is a programming principle where the control of executing a function is handed over to another function. In the context of JavaScript, this typically happens when using callbacks.

-> When we pass a callback function to another function, we are essentially putting our trust in the parent function to execute the callback correctly. We lose control over when, how, and how many times that callback will be executed. This situation can result in issues like unexpected behavior, difficult-to-debug code, and even callback hell.

**Real-World Analogy**

Imagine lending your car to a friend. You trust them to drive safely and return it in good condition. But you lose control over how they drive, whether they return it on time, or if they even return it at all. This loss of control is similar to what happens when we pass callbacks without being certain of their execution, putting our trust in the parent function.

**💡 Inversion of Control Problem**

When using callbacks, several issues may arise, such as:

-> Callback Not Called: The callback might not be invoked at all.
-> Callback Called Multiple Times: The callback may be executed more than once.
-> Wrong Timing: The callback may be called too early or too late.
-> Argument Tampering: The callback might receive modified or unexpected arguments.

**Example 1: Callback Not Called**

Problem Explanation: In this example, the callback may never be called if an error occurs. Since there is a return statement inside the error handling block, the callback is completely skipped.

Step-by-Step Problem Breakdown:

-> The fetchData function tries to simulate data fetching with a random error.
-> If an error occurs, the return statement gets executed, completely skipping the callback.
-> As a result, the callback function does not get a chance to be executed, leaving the operation incomplete.

  ```js 
  
  function fetchData(callback) {
    console.log("Fetching data...");

    setTimeout(() => {
      const error = Math.random() > 0.7; // Simulating random error

      if (error) {
        console.log("Something went wrong!");
        return; // Problem: Callback not called at all
      }

      callback("Data fetched successfully!");
    }, 1000);
  }

  function handleData(response) {
  console.log("Response:", response);
}

fetchData(handleData);

```


**Example 2: Callback Called Multiple Times**

Problem Explanation: Here, the callback function is called more than once, which can lead to unpredictable results. This occurs because there is no check to ensure that the callback is called only once.

Step-by-Step Problem Breakdown:

-> The fetchData function calls the callback twice intentionally.
-> Since there is no check to prevent multiple invocations, both calls are executed.
-> This results in unexpected outputs and potential issues in the application.

```js 

function fetchData(callback) {
  console.log("Fetching data...");

  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data fetched!");
    callback("Unexpected second call!"); // Problem: Called multiple times
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => console.log(data));

```

**Example 3: Wrong Timing**

Problem Explanation: In this example, the callback may execute too early or too late because the delay is unpredictable. This makes it challenging to control the timing of the callback execution.

Step-by-Step Problem Breakdown:

-> The delayedGreeting function sets a random delay before executing the callback.
-> This randomness makes it hard to predict when the callback will run.
->The timing inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior when dependent on timely responses.

```js 

  function delayedGreeting(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      callback("Hello!");
    }, Math.random() * 3000); // Problem: Unpredictable timing
  }

  function greet(message) {
    console.log(message);
  }

  delayedGreeting(greet);

```

**Example 4: Argument Tampering**

Problem Explanation: In this example, the callback function receives an object as an argument. Since objects in JavaScript are passed by reference, any modification to the object inside the callback or after the callback call will directly affect the original object. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the object’s data is altered unintentionally after passing it to the callback.

Step-by-Step Problem Breakdown:

-> The processData function creates an object and immediately calls the callback with it.
-> The callback logs the object data correctly.
-> After the callback execution, the original object is modified.

Since objects are passed by reference, this modification affects the logged data unexpectedly.

```js

function processData(callback) {
  const data = { id: 1, value: "Initial" };
  callback(data);
  data.value = "Tampered"; // Problem: Modifying after callback
}

processData((data) => console.log("Received:", data));

```

The output of the following code snippet:

processData((data) => console.log("Received:", data));
Will be:

Received: { id: 1, value: "Tampered" }

**Why This Output Occurs**

-> The processData function creates an object with id: 1 and value: "Initial".
-> The callback is immediately invoked with the data object.
-> The callback logs the object, but since objects are passed by reference in JavaScript, any change to the object after the callback also reflects in the logged output.
-> After the callback is executed, the value property of the object is changed to "Tampered".
-> When the console.log statement inside the callback runs, it logs the updated value because the object reference is still pointing to the same object in memory.

# 💡 Fixing Inversion of Control with Promises

Promises provide a mechanism to handle asynchronous operations while ensuring that the execution occurs only once, regardless of how many times resolve() or reject() are called. They also help maintain consistency by avoiding callback-related issues.

How Promises Solve the Problems?**

-> Callback Not Called: The promise will either resolve or reject, guaranteeing a response.
-> Callback Called Multiple Times: The promise can be resolved or rejected only once.
-> Wrong Timing: Promises ensure proper chaining and timing control.
-> Argument Tampering: Promises encapsulate data, preventing external tampering.

**Problem 1: Callback Not Called**

How Promises Fix It:
Promises ensure that either resolve() or reject() is called, so the caller always gets a response (either success or failure).

```js

  function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const error = Math.random() > 0.7;

        if (error) {
          reject("Something went wrong!"); // Rejecting the promise on error
          return;
        }

        resolve("Data fetched successfully!"); // Resolving the promise
      }, 1000);
    });
  }

  fetchData()
    .then((data) => console.log("Success:", data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
  
```

Why It Works:
The promise guarantees that either resolve() or reject() will be executed, unlike callbacks that might not be called.

**Problem 2: Callback Called Multiple Times**

How Promises Fix It:
Promises can be resolved or rejected only once, preventing multiple callbacks.

```js

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
      resolve("Unexpected second call!"); // This call is ignored
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData().then((data) => console.log(data));

```
Why It Works:
Once a promise is resolved or rejected, further calls to resolve() or reject() are ignored, ensuring that the callback is executed only once.

**Problem 3: Wrong Timing**

How Promises Fix It:
Promises allow better control over the timing of operations by chaining .then() or using async/await, ensuring proper execution order.

```js

  function delayedGreeting() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Hello!");
      }, 2000); // Fixed delay, ensuring consistent timing
    });
  }

  async function greet() {
    const message = await delayedGreeting();
    console.log(message); // Executes only after the promise is resolved
  }

  greet();

```
Why It Works:
The promise ensures that the callback execution waits for the asynchronous operation to complete, maintaining consistent timing.

**Problem 4: Argument Tampering**

How Promises Fix It:
Promises allow controlled data flow and encapsulation, preventing unintentional modifications.
To avoid this issue, we can use Promises along with a shallow copy of the original object. The best way to do this is to use the spread operator ({ ...data }) or Object.assign() to create a new object. This way, the original data remains untouched.

```js

function processData() {
  const originalData = { id: 1, value: "Initial" };  // Original object
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve({ ...originalData });   // Creating a shallow copy to prevent tampering
  }).then((data) => {
    console.log("Received:", data);  // Logs: { id: 1, value: "Initial" }
    data.value = "Modified";         // Modifying the received data
    console.log("After modification:", data);  // Logs: { id: 1, value: "Modified" }

    // Printing the original object to see if it is affected
    console.log("Original object after modification:", originalData);  // Logs: { id: 1, value: "Initial" }
  });
}

processData();

```

🚀 How This Fix Works

-> The spread operator ({ ...data }) creates a new object with the same properties as the original.This ensures that the new object and the original object do not share the same reference.

-> The resolve() method sends the shallow copy to the .then() method.Any modifications made to the data inside .then() do not affect the original object.


# Fixing Inversion of Control with Async/Await 

**🔥 Problem 1: Callback Not Called (Using Async/Await)**

Why Use Async/Await:
-> Async/await syntax makes it easier to handle asynchronous operations and ensures that the code execution pauses until the promise is resolved or rejected.

```js

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const error = Math.random() > 0.7;

        if (error) {
          reject("Something went wrong!"); // Rejecting the promise on error
          return;
        }

        resolve("Data fetched successfully!"); // Resolving the promise
      }, 1000);
    });

    console.log("Success:", data); // Executes if resolved
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error); // Executes if rejected
  }
}

fetchData();

```

Why It Works:
The await keyword ensures that the function execution pauses until the promise resolves or rejects, and the try...catch block handles any errors gracefully.


Additional notes - 

💡 If resolve() Is Encountered:

The promise is marked as fulfilled.
The await keyword waits for the promise to be fulfilled and returns the resolved value.
The control moves to the next line after the await statement.
The code inside the try block continues executing, so:
console.log("Success:", data); gets executed.

💡 If reject() Is Encountered:

The promise is marked as rejected.
The await keyword immediately throws an error, which is caught by the nearest catch block.
The control moves out of the try block and directly to the catch block.
The code inside the catch block executes:
console.error("Error:", error); gets executed.


-> If resolve() is encountered, the code continues normally after the await.
-> If reject() is encountered, the code jumps directly to the catch block, skipping the rest of the try block.

**🔥 Problem 2: Callback Called Multiple Times (Using Async/Await)**

Why Use Async/Await:
Async/await guarantees that once the promise is resolved or rejected, further attempts are ignored.


```js

async function fetchData() {
  const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
      resolve("Unexpected second call!"); // This call is ignored
    }, 1000);
  });

  console.log(data); // Logs: Data fetched!
}

fetchData();

```

Why It Works:
The promise can be resolved only once, and async/await makes the syntax clean and readable.

**🔥 Problem 3: Wrong Timing (Using Async/Await)**

Why Use Async/Await:
Async/await syntax makes it clear that the function waits for the asynchronous operation to complete before proceeding.

```js

function delayedGreeting() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Hello!");
    }, 2000); // Fixed delay, ensuring consistent timing
  });
}

async function greet() {
  const message = await delayedGreeting();
  console.log(message); // Executes only after the promise is resolved
}

greet();

```

Why It Works:
Async/await makes sure that the greet() function pauses until the greeting message is available, maintaining predictable timing.

**🔥 Problem 4: Argument Tampering (Using Async/Await)**

Why Use Async/Await:
Async/await helps maintain a structured flow and prevents unintended changes to the original object.

```js

function processData() {
  const originalData = { id: 1, value: "Initial" };  // Original object
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve({ ...originalData });   // Creating a shallow copy to prevent tampering
  });
}

async function handleData() {
  const data = await processData();
  console.log("Received:", data);  // Logs: { id: 1, value: "Initial" }

  // Modifying the received data
  data.value = "Modified";
  console.log("After modification:", data);  // Logs: { id: 1, value: "Modified" }

  // Printing the original object to verify it’s not affected
  console.log("Original object after modification:", { id: 1, value: "Initial" });
}

handleData();

```

Why It Works:
The spread operator in the promise ensures that the original object is not altered. The await keyword makes the handling smooth and the code more readable.

**🚀 Why Use Async/Await**

Cleaner Syntax: No need for nested .then() calls, making the code more readable.

Error Handling: Errors can be caught using try...catch, which is more intuitive.

Predictable Flow: Code runs sequentially, making it easy to understand.

Avoiding Callback Hell: Eliminates deeply nested callbacks.


# Notes

-> Inversion of Control occurs when we hand over the control of function execution to another function (like a callback), making the code prone to errors and harder to manage. 

-> Promises and async/await help regain control by ensuring consistent execution, reducing callback-related issues, and making asynchronous code more readable.

-> By using these modern techniques, we can eliminate callback hell and write more maintainable code.
