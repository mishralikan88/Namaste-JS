# Episode 15 : Asynchronous JavaScript & EVENT LOOP from scratch

> Note: Call stack will execeute any execution context which enters it. Time, tide and JS waits for none. TLDR; Call stack has no timer.

* Browser has JS Engine which has Call Stack which has Global execution context, local execution context etc.
  * But browser has many other superpowers - Local storage space, Timer, place to enter URL, Bluetooth access, Geolocation access and so on.
  * Now JS needs a way out to connect the callstack with all these superpowers. This is done using Web APIs.

### WebAPIs
None of the below are part of Javascript! These are extra superpowers that browser has. Browser gives access to JS callstack to use these powers.
![Event Loop 2 Demo](../assets/eventloop2.jpg)

* setTimeout(), DOM APIs, fetch(), localstorage, console (yes, even console.log is not JS!!), location and so many more.
    * setTimeout() : Timer function.
    * DOM APIs : eg.Document.xxxx ; Used to access HTML DOM tree. (Document Object Manipulation)
    * fetch() : Used to make connection with external servers eg. Netflix servers etc.

* We get all these inside call stack through global object ie. window
    * Use window keyword like : window.setTimeout(), window.localstorage, window.console.log() to log something inside console.
    * As window is global obj, and all the above functions are present in global object, we don't explicity write window but it is implied.

* Let's undertand the below code image and its explaination:
    ![Event Loop 3 Demo](../assets/eventloop3.jpg)
    * ```js
      console.log("start");
      setTimeout(function cb() {
          console.log("timer");
      }, 5000);
      console.log("end");
      // start end timer
      ```
    * First a GEC is created and put inside call stack.
    * console.log("Start"); // this calls the console web api (through window) which in turn actually logs values in console.
    * setTimeout(function cb() {
       console.log("timer");
    }, 5000); // This calls the setTimeout web api which gives access to timer feature. It stores the callback cb() and starts timer.

    * console.log("End"); // calls console api and logs "End" in console window. After this GEC pops from call stack.
    * While all this is happening, the timer is constantly ticking. After it becomes 0, the callback cb() has to run.
    * Now we need this cb to go into call stack. Only then will it be executed. For this we need **event loop** and **Callback queue**

### Event Loops and Callback Queue

Q: How after 5 second of time, 'timer' is logged in the console?

* cb() cannot simply directly go to callstack to be execeuted. It goes through the callback queue when timer expires.
* Event loop keep checking the callback queue, and see if it has any element to puts it into call stack. It is like a gate keeper.
* Once cb() is in callback queue, eventloop pushes it to callstack to run.Then the call stack connects with Console API to log 'timer' into the console window.

Q: Another example to understand Eventloop & Callback Queue.

See the below Image and code and try to understand the reason:
![Event Loop 5 Demo](../assets/eventloop5.jpg)
Explaination?

* ```js
  console.log("Start"); 
  document. getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function cb() { 
    // cb() registered inside webapi environment and event(click) gets attached to it. i.e. REGISTERING CALLBACK AND ATTACHING EVENT TO IT. 
    console.log("Callback");
  });
  console.log("End"); // calls console api and logs in console window.

  // After this GEC get removed from call stack.

  // In above code, even after console prints "Start" and "End" and pops GEC out, the eventListener stays in webapi env(with hope that user may click it some day) until explicitly removed, or the browser is closed.
  ```

* Eventloop has just one job i.e. it keeps monitoring callback queue and call stack. It acts like a gate keeper. If it finds some code blocks or statements in the callback queue, it pushes them one by one  into the call stack and deletes them from the callback queue.This only happens when the call stack is empty.

Q: Need of callback/message queue?

**Ans**: Suppose user clicks button x6 times. So 6 cb() are put inside callback queue.At this moment Even loops checks whether the call stack is empty or not . If call stack is empty It pushes these call backs one by one from the callback queue into the call stack till every call backs are executed inside the callstack.

### Behaviour of fetch (**Microtask Queue?**)
Let's observe the code below and try to understand
```js

console.log("Start"); 

setTimeout(function cbT() { 
  console.log("CB Timeout");
}, 5000);

fetch("https://api.netflix.com").then(function cbF() {
    console.log("CB Netflix");
}); 

// millions lines of code 

console.log("End"); 

```
**Code Explaination**

* In first Line, JS engine communicates with console Web API and logs 'Start' in the console window.

* In next line setTimeout takes the call back function cbT and stores it in Web API ENV and attaches a Timer of 5 seconds to it. 

* Moving forward JS encounters fetch method given by browser which makes an API call, But before Making the API call, fetch takes the callback function cbF and stores it in  WEB API env. After that it makes a request to the server.

* At this momment both CbF and cbT functions are stored in WEB API Env.

* Meanwhile JS engine keeps executing the next million lines of code in the call stack . When 5 sec Timer attached to cbT expires, cbT is pushed into the callback queue. Also when data is returned from the server for the fetch API , cbF is pushed into microTask queue.

* Microtask Queue is exactly same as Callback Queue, but it has higher priority. Functions in Microtask Queue are executed earlier than Callback Queue.

* When JS is done executing the last line of code which is console.log("End") , call task is empty.At this moment  function inside microtask queue is pushed into the call stack and the function gets executed inside the callstack.After the function is done with its execution , callstack is empty again.This time function inside message queue is pushed into the call stack and that function is executed inside the callstack.

* These pushing operation of functions from microtasks/message queue to call stack is perfomed by  our Hero **Event Loop** => halke me matt lena :)

#### What enters the Microtask Queue ?
* All the callback functions that come through promises go in microtask Queue.
* **Mutation Observer** : Keeps on checking whether there is mutation in DOM tree or not, and if there is, it execeutes some callback function.
* Callback functions that come through promises and mutation observer go inside **Microtask Queue**.
* All the rest goes inside **Callback Queue aka. MacroTask Queue**.
* If the task in microtask Queue keeps creating new tasks in the queue, element in callback queue never gets chance to be run. This is called **starvation**


### Some Important Questions 

1. **When does the event loop actually start ? -** Event loop, as the name suggests, is a single-thread, loop that is *almost infinite*. It's always running and doing its job.

2. **Are only asynchronous web api callbacks are registered in web api environment? -** YES, the synchronous callback functions like what we pass inside map, filter and reduce aren't registered in the Web API environment. It's just those async callback functions which go through all this.

3. **Does the web API environment stores only the callback function and pushes the same callback to queue/microtask queue? -** Yes, the callback functions are stored, and a reference is scheduled in the queues. Moreover, in the case of event listeners(for example click handlers), the original callbacks stay in the web API environment forever, that's why it's adviced to explicitly remove the listeners when not in use so that the garbage collector does its job.

4. **How does it matter if we delay for setTimeout would be 0ms. Then callback will move to queue without any wait ? -** No, there are trust issues with setTimeout() ðŸ˜…. The callback function needs to wait until the Call Stack is empty. So the 0 ms callback might have to wait for 100ms also if the stack is busy.
